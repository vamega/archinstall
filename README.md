Just another guided/automated [Arch Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Linux) installer with a twist.
The installer also doubles as a python library to install Arch Linux and manage services, packages and other things inside the installed system *(Usually from a live medium)*.

Pre-built ISO's can be found over at https://archlinux.life which autostarts archinstall *(in a safe guided mode)*.

# Installation & Usage

    $ sudo pip install archinstall

Or simply `git clone` the repo as it has no external dependencies *(but there are optional ones)*.<br>
Or run the pre-compiled binary attached in every release as `archinstall-v[ver].tar.gz`.

There's also `PKGBUILD`'s for all the above scenarios.
And they're also available as Arch Linux packages over at the unofficial mirror [https://archlinux.life](https://archlinux.life/).

## Running the [guided](examples/guided.py) installer

Assuming you're on a Arch Linux live-ISO and booted into EFI mode.

    # python -m archinstall guided

# Scripting your own installation

You could just copy [guided.py](examples/guided.py) as a starting point.

But assuming you're building your own ISO and want to create an automated install process, or you want to install virtual machines on to local disk images.<br>
This is probably what you'll need, a [minimal example](examples/main_example.py) of how to install using archinstall as a Python library.

```python
import archinstall, getpass

# Select a harddrive and a disk password
harddrive = archinstall.select_disk(archinstall.all_disks())
disk_password = getpass.getpass(prompt='Disk password (won\'t echo): ')

with archinstall.Filesystem(harddrive, archinstall.GPT) as fs:
    # use_entire_disk() is a helper to not have to format manually
    fs.use_entire_disk('luks2')

    harddrive.partition[0].format('fat32')
    with archinstall.luks2(harddrive.partition[1], 'luksloop', disk_password) as unlocked_device:
        unlocked_device.format('btrfs')
        
        with archinstall.Installer(unlocked_device, hostname='testmachine') as installation:
            if installation.minimal_installation():
                installation.add_bootloader(harddrive.partition[0])

                installation.add_additional_packages(['nano', 'wget', 'git'])
                installation.install_profile('workstation')

                installation.user_create('anton', 'test')
                installation.user_set_pw('root', 'toor')
```

This installer will perform the following:

 * Prompt the user to select a disk and disk-password
 * Proceed to wipe the selected disk with a `GPT` partition table.
 * Sets up a default 100% used disk with encryption.
 * Installs a basic instance of Arch Linux *(base base-devel linux linux-firmware btrfs-progs efibootmgr)*
 * Installs and configures a bootloader to partition 0.
 * Install additional packages *(nano, wget, git)*
 * Installs a network-profile called [workstation](https://github.com/Torxed/archinstall/blob/master/profiles/workstation.json) *(more on network profiles in the docs)*

> **Creating your own ISO with this script on it:** Follow [ArchISO](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/archiso)'s guide on how to create your own ISO or use a pre-built [guided ISO](https://hvornum.se/archiso/) to skip the python installation step, or to create auto-installing ISO templates. Further down are examples and cheat sheets on how to create different live ISO's.

# Testing

To test this without a live ISO, the simplest approach is to use a local image and create a loop device.<br>
This can be done by installing `pacman -S arch-install-scripts util-linux` locally and doing the following:

    # dd if=/dev/zero of=./testimage.img bs=1G count=5
    # losetup -fP ./testimage.img
    # losetup -a | grep "testimage.img" | awk -F ":" '{print $1}'
    # pip install --upgrade archinstall
    # python -m archinstall guided
    # qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -machine q35,accel=kvm -device intel-iommu -cpu host -m 4096 -boot order=d -drive file=./testimage.img,format=raw -drive if=pflash,format=raw,readonly,file=/usr/share/ovmf/x64/OVMF_CODE.fd -drive if=pflash,format=raw,readonly,file=/usr/share/ovmf/x64/OVMF_VARS.fd

This will create a *5GB* `testimage.img` and create a loop device which we can use to format and install to.<br>
`archinstall` is installed and executed in [guided mode](#docs-todo). Once the installation is complete,<br>
~~you can use qemu/kvm to boot the test media.~~ *(You'd actually need to do some EFI magic in order to point the EFI vars to the partition 0 in the test medium so this won't work entirely out of the box, but gives you a general idea of what we're going for here)*

You can also run a pre-built ISO with pip and python

    # qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -cdrom /home/user/Downloads/archinstall-2020.07.08-x86_64.iso -machine q35,accel=kvm -device intel-iommu -cpu host -m 4096 -boot order=d -drive file=./testimage.img,format=raw -drive if=pflash,format=raw,readonly,file=/usr/share/ovmf/x64/OVMF_CODE.fd -drive if=pflash,format=raw,readonly,file=/usr/share/ovmf/x64/OVMF_VARS.fd

and once inside, just do

    # python -m archlinux guided
